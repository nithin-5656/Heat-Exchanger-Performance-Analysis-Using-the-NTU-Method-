# Heat-Exchanger-Performance-Analysis-Using-the-NTU-Method-



This Python script implements the NTU (Number of Transfer Units) Method for analyzing the performance of a heat exchanger. The NTU method is widely used when the outlet temperatures of fluids are unknown, allowing for the calculation of the heat transfer rate between two fluids in a heat exchanger.


Inputs

Heat capacity rates of hot and cold fluids (C_min, C_max)

Overall heat transfer coefficient (U)

Heat exchanger surface area (A)

Inlet temperatures of hot and cold fluids (T_hot_in, T_cold_in)

Choice of heat exchanger type (Counterflow or Parallelflow)


Output

Heat transfer rate (Q) in watts (W)
